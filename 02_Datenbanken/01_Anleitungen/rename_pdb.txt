Step-By-Step

1. Shutdown the pluggable database (PDB).

        sqlplus '/ as sysdba'
        SQL> shutdown pluggable database myplugdb3 close immediate;

2. Startup the PDB in restricted mode

        sqlplus '/ as sysdba'
        SQL> alter pluggable database myplugdb3 open restricted;

3. Rename the PDBs

        sqlplus '/ as sysdba'
        SQL> connect myplugdb3 as sysdba
        SQL> alter pluggable database myplugdb3 rename global_name to myplugdb3_new;

4. Restart the PDB

        sqlplus '/ as sysbda'
        SQL> alter pluggable database close immediate;
        SQL> alter pluggable database open;

    Note
    That the connection to the pluggable database means the database
    name does not need to be specified in the start and stop commands.
